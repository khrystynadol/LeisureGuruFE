# Overview

This is the front end implementation for the LeisureGuru platform.

# Prepare development environment
1. Install Node.js according to [installation instructions](https://nodejs.org/en/download/). This code was built and tested using Node.js 18.9.0 version.

2. Test Node.js installation. 
    - To see if Node is installed, type 
    ```
    node -v
    ```
     in Terminal. This should print the version number so you’ll see something like this v18.9.0.
    - To confirm that npm is installed, type 
    ```
    npm -v
    ```
     in Terminal. This should print the version number so you’ll see something like this 8.19.1
    - To see if npx is installed, type 
    ```
    npx -v
    ```
     in Terminal. This should print the version number so you’ll see something like this 8.19.1

# Building and running
1. Go to the folder react_home in Terminal
2. To run type
``
npm start
``
You'll see something like this :
You can now view react_home in the browser.

  http://localhost:3000

  Open the link in your browser
# Navigation through the web page
There are 2 buttons on the first page :
Registration
Login
    - If you're new to the site, press "Registration" and fill all the required fields, press "Register"
    - If you alredy have an account, press "Login" and type username and password
In both cases, you'll end up on the main page of the web site

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
